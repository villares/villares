> This animation is made with points in a Python collections.deque data structure, added by dragging the mouse (code shown bellow)
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a PhD at Unicamp
- ðŸŒ± I should be talking less and concentrating
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open resources to teach programming in a visual context
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about drawing with Python! 
    - Check out [py5](https://py5.ixora.io), it brings in the Processing drawing infrastructure!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I actually use this repo to store some helper [code](https://github.com/villares/villares) I use in my drawings.

```python
from collections import deque
import py5  # https://github.com/py5coding 

h = deque(maxlen=300)  # mouse drag position history

def setup():
    py5.size(500, 500)
    py5.no_stroke()
    py5.color_mode(py5.HSB)

def draw():
    py5.background(51)
    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(h):
        py5.fill(i, 255, 255, 128)
        py5.circle(x, y, i / 5)
    if h:
        h.append(h.popleft())

def mouse_dragged():
    h.append((py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y))
    
def key_pressed():
    h.clear()

py5.run_sketch()
```
