- âš¡ Fun fact: I think I actually need a repo named *villares* to store some [code](https://github.com/villares/villares).

```python
from collections import deque

h = deque([(0, 0)], 300) # mouse drag position history

def setup():
    size(500, 500)
    noStroke()
    colorMode(HSB)

def draw():
    background(51)
    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(h):
        fill(i, 255, 255, 255 / 2)
        circle(x, y, i / 5)
    h.append(h.popleft())

def mouseDragged():
    h.append((mouseX, mouseY))
```
